# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my teaching materials!

I'm working on two Information Retrieval courses at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), mainly focusing on the master-level Advanced Information Retrieval course. I try to create engaging, fun, and invormative lectures and exercises. 

- The **Introduction to Information Retrieval** course focuses on IR basics and engineering skills of the students.
- The **Advanced Information Retrieval** course focuses on machine learning & neural IR techniques and tries to follow the state-of-the-art in IR research.

## Advanced Information Retrieval 2021

Information Retrieval is the science behind search technology. Certainly, the most visible instances are the large Web Search engines, the likes of Google and Bing, but information retrieval appears everywhere we have to deal with unstructured data (e.g. free text).

**A paradigm shift.** Taking off in 2019 the Information Retrieval research field began an enormous paradigm shift towards utilizing BERT-based language models in various forms to great effect with huge leaps in quality improvements for search results using large-scale training data. This course aims to showcase a slice of these advances in state-of-the-art IR research towards the next generation of search engines.
